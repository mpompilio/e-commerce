# Functionality

This app has a lot of functionality! When looking at a database filled with products, tags, and categories, you can pull the data using Insomina, and adding the local host. 

Once you do that, you can use GET, POST, PULL, and DELETE methods to view or update the data in the databse. 

Each table can be edited, and when you look at Tags, Product, and Categories, you will also see all of the related data.
